 This file defines the interface to shared helper functions for
 converting interleave sets to pools.
 .
 The drivers don't provide pools so they must be constructed.
 The following understanding of pools is used.
 Pools:
 All platform memory capacity forms a single memory pool.
 All mirrored interleave sets on a socket are included in one pool.
 All remaining PM space on a socket is included in one pool. This can include non-mirrored
 interleave sets as well as storage only capacity.
